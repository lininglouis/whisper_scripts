Abstract
Natural language understanding comprises a wide range of diverse tasks such
as textual entailment, question answering, semantic similarity assessment, and
document classiﬁcation. Although large unlabeled text corpora are abundant,
labeled data for learning these speciﬁc tasks is scarce, making it challenging for
discriminatively trained models to perform adequately. We demonstrate that large
gains on these tasks can be realized by generative pre-training of a language model
on a diverse corpus of unlabeled text, followed by discriminative ﬁne-tuning on each
speciﬁc task. In contrast to previous approaches, we make use of task-aware input
transformations during ﬁne-tuning to achieve effective transfer while requiring
minimal changes to the model architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach on a wide range of benchmarks for natural language understanding.
Our general task-agnostic model outperforms discriminatively trained models that
use architectures speciﬁcally crafted for each task, signiﬁcantly improving upon the
state of the art in 9 out of the 12 tasks studied. For instance, we achieve absolute
improvements of 8.9% on commonsense reasoning (Stories Cloze Test), 5.7% on
question answering (RACE), and 1.5% on textual entailment (MultiNLI).
1 Introduction
The ability to learn effectively from raw text is crucial to alleviating the dependence on supervised
learning in natural language processing (NLP). Most deep learning methods require substantial
amounts of manually labeled data, which restricts their applicability in many domains that suffer
from a dearth of annotated resources [ 61]. In these situations, models that can leverage linguistic
information from unlabeled data provide a valuable alternative to gathering more annotation, which
can be time-consuming and expensive. Further, even in cases where considerable supervision
is available, learning good representations in an unsupervised fashion can provide a signiﬁcant
performance boost. The most compelling evidence for this so far has been the extensive use of pre-
trained word embeddings [ 10,39,42] to improve performance on a range of NLP tasks [ 8,11,26,45].
Leveraging more than word-level information from unlabeled text, however, is challenging for two
main reasons. First, it is unclear what type of optimization objectives are most effective at learning
text representations that are useful for transfer. Recent research has looked at various objectives
such as language modeling [ 44], machine translation [ 38], and discourse coherence [ 22], with each
method outperforming the others on different tasks.1Second, there is no consensus on the most
effective way to transfer these learned representations to the target task. Existing techniques involve
a combination of making task-speciﬁc changes to the model architecture [ 43,44], using intricate
learning schemes [ 21] and adding auxiliary learning objectives [ 50]. These uncertainties have made
it difﬁcult to develop effective semi-supervised learning approaches for language processing.

Preprint. Work in progress.In this paper, we explore a semi-supervised approach for language understanding tasks using a
combination of unsupervised pre-training and supervised ﬁne-tuning. Our goal is to learn a universal
representation that transfers with little adaptation to a wide range of tasks. We assume access to
a large corpus of unlabeled text and several datasets with manually annotated training examples
(target tasks). Our setup does not require these target tasks to be in the same domain as the unlabeled
corpus. We employ a two-stage training procedure. First, we use a language modeling objective on
the unlabeled data to learn the initial parameters of a neural network model. Subsequently, we adapt
these parameters to a target task using the corresponding supervised objective.
For our model architecture, we use the Transformer [62], which has been shown to perform strongly on
various tasks such as machine translation [ 62], document generation [ 34], and syntactic parsing [ 29].
This model choice provides us with a more structured memory for handling long-term dependencies in
text, compared to alternatives like recurrent networks, resulting in robust transfer performance across
diverse tasks. During transfer, we utilize task-speciﬁc input adaptations derived from traversal-style
approaches [ 52], which process structured text input as a single contiguous sequence of tokens. As
we demonstrate in our experiments, these adaptations enable us to ﬁne-tune effectively with minimal
changes to the architecture of the pre-trained model.
We evaluate our approach on four types of language understanding tasks – natural language inference,
question answering, semantic similarity, and text classiﬁcation. Our general task-agnostic model
outperforms discriminatively trained models that employ architectures speciﬁcally crafted for each
task, signiﬁcantly improving upon the state of the art in 9 out of the 12 tasks studied. For instance,
we achieve absolute improvements of 8.9% on commonsense reasoning (Stories Cloze Test) [ 40],
5.7% on question answering (RACE) [ 30], 1.5% on textual entailment (MultiNLI) [ 66] and 5.5% on
the recently introduced GLUE multi-task benchmark [ 64]. We also analyzed zero-shot behaviors
of the pre-trained model on four different settings and demonstrate that it acquires useful linguistic
knowledge for downstream tasks.
2 Related Work
Semi-supervised learning for NLP Our work broadly falls under the category of semi-supervised
learning for natural language. This paradigm has attracted signiﬁcant interest, with applications to
tasks like sequence labeling [ 24,33,57] or text classiﬁcation [ 41,70]. The earliest approaches used
unlabeled data to compute word-level or phrase-level statistics, which were then used as features in a
supervised model [33]. Over the last few years, researchers have demonstrated the beneﬁts of using
word embeddings [ 11,39,42], which are trained on unlabeled corpora, to improve performance on a
variety of tasks [ 8,11,26,45]. These approaches, however, mainly transfer word-level information,
whereas we aim to capture higher-level semantics.
Recent approaches have investigated learning and utilizing more than word-level semantics from
unlabeled data. Phrase-level or sentence-level embeddings, which can be trained using an unlabeled
corpus, have been used to encode text into suitable vector representations for various target tasks [ 28,
32, 1, 36, 22, 12, 56, 31].
Unsupervised pre-training Unsupervised pre-training is a special case of semi-supervised learning
where the goal is to ﬁnd a good initialization point instead of modifying the supervised learning
objective. Early works explored the use of the technique in image classiﬁcation [ 20,49,63] and
regression tasks [ 3]. Subsequent research [ 15] demonstrated that pre-training acts as a regularization
scheme, enabling better generalization in deep neural networks. In recent work, the method has
been used to help train deep neural networks on various tasks like image classiﬁcation [ 69], speech
recognition [68], entity disambiguation [17] and machine translation [48].
The closest line of work to ours involves pre-training a neural network using a language modeling
objective and then ﬁne-tuning it on a target task with supervision. Dai et al. [ 13] and Howard and
Ruder [ 21] follow this method to improve text classiﬁcation. However, although the pre-training
phase helps capture some linguistic information, their usage of LSTM models restricts their prediction
ability to a short range. In contrast, our choice of transformer networks allows us to capture longer-
range linguistic structure, as demonstrated in our experiments. Further, we also demonstrate the
effectiveness of our model on a wider range of tasks including natural language inference, paraphrase
detection and story completion. Other approaches [ 43,44,38] use hidden representations from a
2pre-trained language or machine translation model as auxiliary features while training a supervised
model on the target task. This involves a substantial amount of new parameters for each separate
target task, whereas we require minimal changes to our model architecture during transfer.
Auxiliary training objectives Adding auxiliary unsupervised training objectives is an alternative
form of semi-supervised learning. Early work by Collobert and Weston [ 10] used a wide variety of
auxiliary NLP tasks such as POS tagging, chunking, named entity recognition, and language modeling
to improve semantic role labeling. More recently, Rei [ 50] added an auxiliary language modeling
objective to their target task objective and demonstrated performance gains on sequence labeling
tasks. Our experiments also use an auxiliary objective, but as we show, unsupervised pre-training
already learns several linguistic aspects relevant to target tasks.
3 Framework
Our training procedure consists of two stages. The ﬁrst stage is learning a high-capacity language
model on a large corpus of text. This is followed by a ﬁne-tuning stage, where we adapt the model to
a discriminative task with labeled data.
